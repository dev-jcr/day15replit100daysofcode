# Infinite Loop

You have to be **really** careful that you don't accidentally invoke an infinite loop! This is where the computer will loop code until the end of time. Without a break. Forever. ðŸ˜­

## Fix an infinite loop by adding: 

```python
  variable +=1
  ```

This is just saying "count to 10 by 1 each time." to make the loop end.

Don't forget, if your **condition** is a `>` then you might need to `-=`. This will subtract from the variable instead of adding to it.

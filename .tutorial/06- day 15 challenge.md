# ðŸ‘‰ Day 15 Challenge


Write a program that loops. Inside the loop, ask the user what animal sound they want to hear. 


## Example

```
What animal do you want?: Cow
A cow goes moo.

Do you want to exit?: no

What animal do you want?: A Lesser Spotted lemur
Ummm...the Lesser Spotter Lemur goes awooga.

Do you want to exit?: yes

```

- You will need to start with a while loop.
- Add nested if statements inside the while loop.
- End with `exit` for the user to get out of the loop.
